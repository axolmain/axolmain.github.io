                <h1>Why choose us?</h1>
                <p>Bread and Fish is an alternative to Door dash, UberEATS, Grub Hub, etc. with one key
                     difference. Rather than charging users COVID-19 fees, absurd delivery fees, 
                     service charges, and additional fees that don’t need to be charged, we’ll 
                     only charge one fee because of our minimal costs and don’t require a tip 
                     because it’s a robot delivering food. You pay cheaper prices for 
                     the same products as competitors, it’s more environmentally friendly, and gives
                     more student discounts. You can order food from the comfort of your own home, 
                     track the delivery without risking privacy of drivers, plus see a cool  
                     robot deliver food. Our prices include tax already so you 
                     don’t need to guess how much tax they pay until see the full price.</p>

                <h1>What's the benefit of switching?</h1>
                <p>With Bread and Fishyou can maximise your work/fun, by saving the time it takes 
                    to cook and clean up. The benefit of Bread and Fish is that we are
                     specialized for BYU students and the 
                    campuses, offering special deals for students. The delivery method is also 
                    contactless but still brings the food right to your door because it’s via 
                    robots instead of people. It’s cheaper than alternatives regardless of the 
                    special deals due to the saved costs that come with using robots rather than 
                    people.</p>
