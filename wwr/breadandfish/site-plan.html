      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wondered why a $5 food delivery order costs $12? It’s because of all the fees that come with ordering food from 
          human drivers. What if you could open a website with all the same options, order food, and have a robot deliver it right to 
          your door without all those fees? Ordering from B&F would mean just that, you can enjoy the benefits of food delivery without 
          worrying about breaking your bank account. With an interactive website and an easy-to-read interface you can log in and find 
          your favorite meals straight from your couch and all you need to do it open the door and grab the food. </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Do you order food but don't like all the fees? Have you needed to save money on groceries or going out just to satisfy your
          unquenchable thirst for 3am food delivery? College students already have so much debt to pay off, why waste money on useless things
          when you could have convieniency and save money? We look to help those wanting to save money with no expense to their quality of
          life.

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
      My site is an alternative to Door dash, UberEATS, Grub Hub, etc. with 
      one key difference. Rather than charging users COVID-19 fees, absurd 
      delivery fees, service charges, and additional fees that don’t need to 
      be charged, we’ll only charge one fee because of our minimal costs 
      and don’t require a tip because it’s a robot delivering food. They’ll 
      come to pay cheaper prices for the same products as competitors, it’s 
      more environmentally friendly, it’s connected with the BYUs to give 
      students discounts and deals. They can order food from the comfort 
      of their home, track the delivery without risking privacy of drivers, 
      and it’s cool to see a robot deliver food. Also, the prices will be 
      with tax included so people don’t need to guess how much tax they pay 
      until see the full price.

      <h3>What makes Bread & Fish© stand out?</h3>
      <p>
        Visitors will come to my site because it’s a site where they can 
        actualize, they’re lazy potential, and save the time it takes to 
        cook and utilize that for homework/work. The difference between my 
        website and other food delivery websites is that my website will be 
        specialized for BYU students and the campuses, offering special 
        deals for students. The delivery method is also contactless but 
        still brings the food right to your door because it’s via robots 
        instead of people. It’s cheaper than alternatives regardless of the 
        special deals due to the saved costs that come with using robots rather 
        than people.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Visitors will expect my site to answer any question the other delivery 
        services answer, plus specific news regarding our partners. They will 
        want to see the restaurants that use deliver using the robots, they 
        want to see the full menu of said restaurants with consequent prices 
        (tax included), and how long the delivery will take. They will want to 
        see where their delivery currently is (and what stage of delivery it’s 
        in) , and where they can order (a map with a radius or the opportunity 
        for them to put their address in and the computer to say it’s okay or 
        not).
