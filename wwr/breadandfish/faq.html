                    <p>Instead of using cars and peopple to deliver, we take a more environmental approach
                    to food delivery and use solar panel powered robots. All assembled using recycled 
                    materials where possible. We work to make every part of the process as efficient
                    and environmentally friendly as possible</p>

                    <p>Typical food delivery companies use one app for ordering and one app for delivery drivers,
                        but this alone costs more than just hosting one app. We only use one app as we don't offer 
                        the option to delivery, but because of this we don't have the cost of hosting an extra app
                        or the need for paying drivers. We only charge a small delivery fee for maintenance and the 
                        rest comes from resturants and advertisement.

                    <p>Being a service made by BYUI students, we offer any on-campus resturants delivery with 
                        complimentary delivery, and a wide variety of off-campus resturants. McDonalds, Wendys, 
                        Burger King, Panda Express and many more!

                    <p>We charge resturants 5% of each order and use non-invasive ads to get most of our revenue. Aside 
                        from this we charge a 20% up to $3 delivery fee as a base, but have many deals and days where 
                        this fee is either non existent, or only on certain items. If you purchase a monthly subscription,
                        you receive exclusive deals PLUS don't need to pay any delivery fees!
